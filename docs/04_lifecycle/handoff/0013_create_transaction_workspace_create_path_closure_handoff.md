# 0013 - Create Transaction Workspace Create Path Closure Handoff

## FACT

This handoff records the closure of the create-path slice for HyperPOS transaction workspace.

Completed scope:

1. Create transaction workspace service + store-stock package auto split.
2. Multi-product service + store-stock create UI.
3. Compact qty UI across create workflows.
4. Note-level operational note / keterangan nota.
5. Structural refactors required by audit-lines.
6. Full verification closure for the completed create slice.

Local proof was provided by the owner during the session.

## COMPLETED CHANGES

### 1. Service store-stock package auto split create path

Create transaction workspace now supports service + store-stock package auto split for create path.

Covered behavior:

- 1 product package auto split.
- 2 different products in one service + store-stock package row.
- Duplicate product rejection.
- Package total equal sparepart minimum.
- Package total below sparepart minimum rejection.
- Browser-form string payload handling.
- Partial payment interaction remains covered by focused test.

### 2. Multi-product create UI

The create UI for `service_store_stock` now supports dynamic product lines.

Implemented behavior:

- Add product line button.
- Remove product line button.
- Product line reindexing for `product_lines[n]`.
- Per-line product search scope.
- Per-line qty.
- Summary supports multiple `[data-product-line]` scopes.
- Payment guard validates all product lines.
- Draft serialization/restoration supports multiple product lines.

### 3. Qty compact UI

Qty inputs were compacted uniformly.

Affected workflows:

- Product-only.
- Service + store-stock first product line.
- Service + store-stock cloned product lines.
- Service + external purchase.

Old large qty controls with decrement/increment buttons were removed from the Blade templates.

### 4. Note-level operational note

A note-level `operational_note` was added.

Implemented changes:

- Migration added `notes.operational_note`.
- Workspace info card now has `Keterangan Nota`.
- `StoreTransactionWorkspaceRules` accepts `note.operational_note`.
- `UpdateTransactionWorkspaceRules` accepts `note.operational_note`.
- `StoreTransactionWorkspaceNoteNormalizer` normalizes `operational_note`.
- `CreateTransactionWorkspaceNoteFactory` passes `operational_note` to domain `Note`.
- Domain `Note` stores and exposes `operationalNote()`.
- `DatabaseNoteWriterAdapter` inserts and updates `operational_note`.
- `NoteMapper` rehydrates `operational_note`.
- `boot.js` hydrates `note_operational_note`.
- `draft.js` serializes `note.operational_note`.

Visible per-workflow `Catatan Servis` fields were removed from:

- Service-only template.
- Service + external purchase template.

Hidden empty `service[notes]` compatibility fields may remain where needed.

### 5. Audit-lines refactors

The following refactors were made to satisfy the 100-line audit rule without compacting code:

- `StoreTransactionWorkspaceGrandTotalCalculator` was split into smaller calculator classes.
- `NoteDueDateCalculator` was introduced.
- `NoteMutations::updateHeader()` now uses `NoteDueDateCalculator::calculate()`.

Earlier full verification outputs during the slice included:

Tests: 2 skipped, 1119 passed (6313 assertions)
Manual browser proof

Owner confirmed:

ok berhasil semua

For create service + store-stock package auto split multi-product.

Owner later confirmed:

ok bisa dan ui memuaskan

For note-level Alasan Nota and final create UI.

SQL proof

Owner provided SQL result showing operational_note persisted:

id: 9154c00f-c1e5-4c17-ade4-bec61860a42a
customer_name: Pelanggan baru
transaction_date: 2026-05-31
operational_note: xxixixi
total_rupiah: 676500
CLOSED STATUS

Create path baseline is closed for the completed scope.

Closed:

Create service + store-stock package auto split.
Create multi-product UI.
Create package validation.
Create duplicate product backend rejection.
Create package allocation audit.
Create report impact baseline.
Create inline payment lifecycle baseline.
Qty compact UI.
Note-level operational note storage.
Full verification gate.
GAP

Not closed in this handoff:

Detail UI.
Need verify whether operational_note is displayed.
Need verify package auto split multi-product detail readability.
Need verify package allocation / service residual / parts display.
Edit/revision.
Need inspect update/edit path for first-line assumptions.
UpdateTransactionWorkspaceRules appears less mature than create rules.
Need ensure operational_note can edit/update header.
Need ensure multi-product store-stock survives edit/revision.
Need ensure revision snapshot and settlement impacts are correct.
Refund.
Need inspect refund path for package auto split semantics.
Need ensure stock reversal/payment/refund/allocation behavior is correct.
Reporting/export/detail polish.
operational_note may not be displayed everywhere.
Report/export display is not closed.
Client-side duplicate product guard.
Backend duplicate rejection exists.
Client-side UX guard may still be missing.
DECISION

Next active step should be detail UI characterization.

Reason:

Create storage is closed.
Detail view is safer and narrower than edit/refund.
Detail view proof is needed before editing/refunding package auto split data.
Detail findings will inform edit/revision/refund expected semantics.
RECOMMENDED NEXT COMMANDS

Run from repo root:

rg -n "operational_note|note_header|customer_name|transaction_date|line_summary|store_stock|package_auto_split|package_alloc|allocation|work_item_store_stock_lines" \
resources/views \
app/Application/Note/Services \

tests/Feature/Reporting
rg -n "NoteDetail|DetailPage|note detail|cashier.notes.show|admin.notes.show|operational_note|package_auto_split" \
routes \
app \
resources/views \
tests

Then inspect:

note detail page data builder
note detail blade views
revision/detail view data
package allocation display source
tests covering note detail

Do not patch until detail UI blueprint is written.

## ADDENDUM - Final create/detail/report verification closure after Alasan Nota terminology cleanup

### FACT

This addendum supersedes stale open gaps in earlier sections for the create/detail/report verification slice.

Latest verified local state:

- Create transaction workspace service + store-stock package auto split remains closed.
- Multi-product service + store-stock create UI remains closed.
- Package auto split create DB persistence remains closed.
- Package allocation audit remains closed.
- Create report impact baseline remains closed.
- Detail UI package breakdown remains closed.
- Detail UI note-level text field is now labeled 'Alasan Nota'.
- The underlying persisted field remains 'notes.operational_note'.
- No separate create-level 'note_reason' or 'transaction_reason' field was introduced.
- Existing 'reason' fields remain lifecycle-action reasons for revision/refund/correction/reopen/surplus/audit flows.
- Reporting/page/export date expectation drift after 'ViewDateFormatter' was reconciled.
- Final 'make verify' passed locally.

### IMPLEMENTED / VERIFIED TERMINOLOGY

'Keterangan Nota' was renamed to 'Alasan Nota' in the create/detail UI terminology layer only.

Affected files:

- resources/views/cashier/notes/workspace/partials/info-card.blade.php
- resources/views/shared/notes/partials/header-summary.blade.php
- tests/Feature/Note/NoteDetailOperationalPackageVisibilityFeatureTest.php

No DB/domain rename was performed.

Reason:

- 'notes.operational_note' is the existing note-level text field.
- 'reason' is already used for lifecycle audit semantics.
- Adding a second create-level reason field would be a new product/domain scope and was not part of this closure.

### PROOF

CLOSED STATUS

Create/detail/report baseline is closed for the completed scope.

Closed:
- Create service + store-stock package auto split.
- Create multi-product UI.
- Create package validation.
- Create duplicate product backend rejection.
- Create package allocation audit.
- Create report impact baseline.
- Create inline payment lifecycle baseline.
- Qty compact UI.
- Note-level operational_note persistence.
- UI terminology label Alasan Nota.
- Detail Alasan Nota visibility.
- Detail package breakdown visibility:
  - Paket total
  - Total sparepart
  - Sisa jasa
  - store-stock part product names
- Reporting/page/export date expectation reconciliation after Indonesian ViewDateFormatter.
- PHPStan gate.
- audit-lines gate.
- audit-blade gate.
- Full make verify gate.

STILL OPEN / NEXT SCOPE

Not closed by this handoff:
- Edit/revision lifecycle for service + store-stock package auto split.
- Refund lifecycle for service + store-stock package auto split.
- Boundary bug matrix after edit/refund:
  - multi-product store-stock after edit,
  - package residual after revision,
  - revision snapshot and settlement impact,
  - refund stock reversal behavior,
  - refund/payment allocation after package autosplit,
  - stale/historical row behavior after revision,
  - client-side duplicate product UX guard if still required.

DECISION
- Do not treat create/detail proof as edit/refund proof.
- Next work must start as a new scope: Phase 3 - Edit/Revision lifecycle characterization for service store-stock package auto split.
- First step in the next scope must be characterization only, not patching.
