# Handoff

This folder stores session recovery notes for the active or latest session.

## Rules

- One file per session or per session topic.
- Naming: `NNNN_topic_handoff.md`
- After a session is finished and no longer relevant, move it to `docs/99_archive/handoff/`.
- Do not keep permanent decisions here only - promote them to `docs/02_architecture/adr`.
- Do not keep active blueprints here - promote them to `docs/03_blueprints`.
- Canonical handoff template: `docs/01_standards/0005_handoff_template.md`

## Note

This folder is only for active or latest handoffs. Once a session is closed, archive it to `docs/99_archive/handoff/` so the history remains while the active workflow stays clean.

## Source of Truth Priority

1. Latest local operator output
2. `docs/01_standards`
3. `docs/02_architecture/adr`
4. Active blueprint in `docs/03_blueprints`
5. Latest handoff in this folder
6. Archive in `docs/99_archive/handoff`
