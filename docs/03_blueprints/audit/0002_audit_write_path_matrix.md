# Audit Write Path Matrix

## Status

Draft readiness matrix.

This document is not implementation proof.

This document does not authorize audit outbox implementation.

This document does not authorize switching `AuditEventWriterPort` binding to an outbox writer.

## Source Snapshot

Local proof provided by owner:

- repo root: `/home/asyraf/Code/laravel/bengkel2/app`
- branch: `main...origin/main`
- HEAD: `44d783cf`

## Purpose

Map the current HyperPOS audit write paths before changing audit runtime behavior.

The immediate goal is to prevent unsafe migration from legacy `AuditLogPort` writes to canonical `AuditEventWriterPort` or future audit outbox without knowing which mutation flows are affected.

## Binding Facts

Current binding from source inventory:

- `AuditEventWriterPort` is bound to `DatabaseAuditEventWriterAdapter`.
- `AuditLogPort` is bound to `DatabaseAuditLogAdapter`.

Current runtime implication:

- canonical audit events are written directly to `audit_events` and `audit_event_snapshots`;
- legacy audit events are written to `audit_logs`;
- no runtime `audit_outbox` file was found in `app`, `database`, or `tests` during local file check.

## Canonical Audit Path

| Area | File | Event / factory | Current behavior | Classification | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Note | `app/Application/Note/UseCases/CreateNoteRevisionSurplusRefundDueHandler.php` | `CreateNoteRevisionSurplusRefundDueAuditEventFactory` | Calls `AuditEventWriterPort::write()` inside transaction before disposition writer create and commit | canonical | Existing canonical audit path. Finance-sensitive. Not a first broad outbox switch target without focused proof. |
| Note | `app/Application/Note/UseCases/RecordNoteRevisionSurplusRefundPaymentHandler.php` | `RecordNoteRevisionSurplusRefundPaymentAuditEventFactory` | Calls `AuditEventWriterPort::write()` inside transaction before payment writer create and commit | canonical | Existing canonical audit path with idempotency check. Finance-sensitive. Requires focused proof before any binding change. |
| Test | `tests/Feature/AuditLog/DatabaseAuditEventWriterAdapterTest.php` | `new AuditEventWrite(...)` | Tests canonical adapter | canonical_test | Adapter test only. Not a mutation flow. |

## Non-Audit Or Needs-Separation Calls

These calls appeared in broad `record()` / `write()` grep but must not be classified as audit without source proof:

| Pattern | Reason |
|---|---|
| `timeline->record(...)` | Timeline write, not `AuditLogPort` by itself |
| `reversals->record(...)` | Business reversal writer, not audit by itself |
| `reversalWriter->record(...)` | Business reversal writer, not audit by itself |
| `adjustmentWriter->record(...)` | Business adjustment writer, not audit by itself |
| `payments->record(...)` | Payment recorder, not audit by itself |
| Reporting Excel workbook `->write(...)` calls | Export writer calls, not `AuditEventWriterPort` |

## First-Pilot Candidate Notes

Do not pick a transaction-heavy first pilot.

Explicitly excluded for first outbox pilot:

- customer payment allocation
- customer refund
- selected-row refund
- transaction workspace create/update
- paid correction
- note revision commit
- inventory stock mutation/reversal
- supplier receipt/payment/reversal
- employee finance payment/reversal/payroll
- projection rebuilds

Possible later pilot candidates after source and test proof:

- expense category update / activate / deactivate
- identity access capability enable / disable
- identity access capability used audit

These are only candidates, not decisions.

## Required Proof Before Any Outbox Implementation

Before implementing `audit_outbox`, provide:

1. owner approval of first pilot flow;
2. source inspection for the selected pilot;
3. red/green or characterization test for existing audit behavior;
4. proof of current legacy audit payload;
5. migration design for `audit_outbox`;
6. adapter test for outbox writer;
7. processor test for canonical materialization;
8. retry/failure behavior proof;
9. duplicate processor run proof;
10. proof that canonical `audit_events` and `audit_event_snapshots` are materialized correctly.

## Stop Conditions

Stop before implementation if:

- selected pilot touches payment/refund/allocation/transaction workspace;
- selected pilot touches stock mutation/reversal;
- selected pilot touches payroll/debt/payment finance flows;
- selected pilot requires public contract change;
- selected pilot has no characterization test path;
- source inspection shows audit payload lacks actor/reason/source facts needed for canonical audit;
- owner decision is missing.

## Next Active Step

Read source and tests for one candidate group before choosing a pilot.

Recommended candidate group for inspection:

- expense category update / activate / deactivate

Reason:

- non-transaction category maintenance is likely lower risk than payment, refund, stock, procurement, or employee finance;
- source snippets show before/after payload for update;
- still requires source and test proof before decision.
