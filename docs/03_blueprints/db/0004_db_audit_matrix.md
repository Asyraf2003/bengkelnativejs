# DB Blueprint 0004 - DB Audit Matrix

Status: Active audit matrix  
Scope: P0 database hardening matrix for temporal audit, PostgreSQL readiness, CRUD/read path readiness  
Owner: HyperPOS  

## 1. Purpose

Dokumen ini menjadi matrix kerja untuk menyelesaikan masalah database hardening satu per satu.

Matrix ini mengikuti:

- `docs/03_blueprints/db/0001_temporal_audit_columns_blueprint.md`
- `docs/03_blueprints/db/0002_mysql_postgresql_crud_readiness_blueprint.md`
- `docs/03_blueprints/db/0003_db_hardening_workflow.md`
- `docs/02_architecture/adr/0028_mysql_to_postgresql_and_api_migration_readiness.md`

Patch schema tidak boleh dimulai hanya karena row sudah ada di matrix. Patch baru boleh dimulai setelah source proof, writer proof, read path proof, backfill policy, dan targeted proof plan cukup.

## 2. Status Legend

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Reported | Gap or target has been identified. |
| Audited | Source and current behavior have been inspected. |
| Patch Blueprinted | Narrow patch plan exists with scope and proof plan. |
| Characterized RED | Test or characterization proves current gap. |
| Patched Unverified | Source patch exists but proof is incomplete. |
| Targeted Verified | Targeted proof passes for the active gap. |
| Focused Verified | Focused blast-radius proof passes. |
| Docs Aligned | Docs reflect source, proof, and remaining gaps. |
| Deferred with owner acceptance | Scope is intentionally deferred with explicit acceptance. |

## 4. Active Slice

Current active table group:

- `notes`

Current proven problem:

- `notes` is the root transaction header.
- `notes` has business date and lifecycle action timestamps.
- `notes` does not have proven system row timestamps.
- Current writer creates and updates `notes` without `created_at` or `updated_at`.
- Many tests and seeders direct insert into `notes`, so a naive non-null timestamp patch can break fixtures.

## 5. Current Decision

Do not patch schema yet.

Next safe step:

- Create a narrow patch blueprint for `notes`.
- Define whether the first patch should add only `created_at`, or both `created_at` and `updated_at`.
- Define deterministic backfill policy without inventing historical creation time.
- Define RED/characterization test and focused blast-radius tests before implementation.


## 6. Notes Timestamp Patch Proof - 2026-05-15

Status for `notes`: Focused Verified.

Production files changed:

- `database/migrations/2026_05_15_000100_add_system_timestamps_to_notes_table.php`
- `app/Adapters/Out/Note/DatabaseNoteWriterAdapter.php`

Test files changed:

- `tests/Feature/Database/V2NoteOperationalStateMigrationTest.php`
- `tests/Feature/Note/NoteOperationalStatePersistenceFeatureTest.php`

Proof:

- RED targeted schema test: `V2NoteOperationalStateMigrationTest` failed with `Missing notes.created_at`, 1 failed, 2 passed, 20 assertions.
- GREEN targeted schema test: `V2NoteOperationalStateMigrationTest` passed, 3 tests, 21 assertions.
- GREEN targeted writer persistence test: `NoteOperationalStatePersistenceFeatureTest` passed, 2 tests, 16 assertions.
- Focused create flow test: `CreateNoteFeatureTest` passed, 3 tests, 10 assertions.
- Focused blast-radius suite passed, 31 tests, 186 assertions.
- `git diff --check` produced no output after focused verification.

Remaining gaps:

- Full `make verify` has not been proven in this slice.
- Browser/manual QA has not been run.
- PostgreSQL migration runtime has not been executed because PostgreSQL is not active.
- Timestamp read path/index hardening is not approved because no real timestamp read path has been proven.

Next table group:

- `customer_payments` and `customer_refunds` audit.
